# About me
Hey there! I'm Roberto! (Also known as [Burger](https://www.youtube.com/c/burgerman1))

I make Games, Software, Videos and alot more. I've fallen in love with tech since 2018 when i wanted to learn how to make websites in HTML and CSS. Since then i learned ALOT about tech. [Carbon](https://github.com/CarbonEmSelf) and me created some projects together.)
I know C#, LUA, Batch, Python, HTML, CSS and a litte bit of JS.
