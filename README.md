Hey there! I'm Roberto! (Also known as [Burger](https://www.youtube.com/c/burgerman1))

I make Games, Software, Videos and alot more. I've fallen in love with tech since 2018 when i wanted to learn how to make websites in HTML and CSS. Since then i learned ALOT about tech. ([Carbon](https://github.com/CarbonEmSelf) and me created some projects together.)
I know C#, LUA, Batch, Python, HTML, CSS and a litte bit of JS.


# Projects i'm working on

### Simple BruteForce (Visual Studio Code, Python)
> I made a simple [brute force](https://github.com/Burger-man/About-me/blob/main/scripts/BruteForce.py) in python because i forgot my password of my locked ZIP :C
> I won't use it to open someones else ZIP files...or will i?
